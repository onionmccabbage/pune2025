### JavaScript Exercise

* Write a function to handle the form button click event
* In the HTML document, add an 'onlick()' event handler to the button
* Remember to prevent the default form behviour

* Within the event handler, grab the values of the chosen country and cost from the document (you will need to give each of the form elements an id)
* Build a nice string containing the values
* Append this string to the output monitor element

* If time, every time the user clicks the button, append their choices to a list (or your own UX choice). You will probably use 
    - document.createElement()
    - .setAttribute() or .innerHTML
    - .appendChild() 

* Explore using &lt;input type='range' /&gt; for the cost form field
