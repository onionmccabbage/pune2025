### JavaScript Exercise
Get hold of a copy of the 'formLab.html' document from this repository
* Create a new script file and add a suitable &lt;script&gt; tag in the 'formLab.html' document
* Write a function to handle the button click event
* In the HTML document, add an 'onlick()' event handler to the button
* Remember to prevent the default form behviour

* Within the event handler, grab the values of the chosen country and cost from the document (you will need to give each of the form elements an id)
* Build a nice string containing the chosen values
* Append this string to the 'output' element in the web document

* As you develop your code see if there are opportunities to split your JavaScript across modules

* If you have time try this: every time the user clicks the button, append their choices to am unordered list (or your own UX choice). You will probably use 
    * document.createElement()
    * .appendChild() or .innerHTML

* Explore using &lt;input type='range' /&gt; for the 'cost' form field. 
* How can you show the value represented by the 'range' form field?
