### Access Remote API data
Use fetch to access the countries from the API end-point
(You choose where to write this: it can be in DataFunctions.js or in another code module)

Create a new Component (you decide on the name)

In this new component, useEffect() to load the countries

Show all the loaded countries however you see fit
- You could use list items or a table
- you could populate a &lt;select&gt; field

Consider using try-catch and check the response is ok
