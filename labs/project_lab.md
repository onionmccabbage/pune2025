### Lab related to Team Project Work

You may like to continue thinking about your project front end. It is for your team to decide what you end up with, but you could begin building some user interface ideas using HTML and CSS 
(You may end up using Bootstrap or similar for your CSS)

**Remember: there must be no Citi branding whatsoever**

You could invent some web document ideas, e.g.
* Create layout spaces where content will go, without filling in any details
* Consider user interaction, navigation, any content to show/hide, asynchronous content etc.

We will cover more about interactions when we look at React, but you could try the following:
* Think about how you will use asynchronous JavaScript to fetch data (GET, POST, PATCH and UPATE)
* Will you need to use map or filter
* Consider how and when your back end data will be accessed, and how you might show it to the user
* Also consider how data changes wil be implemented in the front end (CRUD) 
* Use your web document ideas to consider the user experience, especially user stories
