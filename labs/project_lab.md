### Lab related to Team Project Work

You may like to continue thinking about your project front end. It is for your team to decide what you end up with, but you could begin building some user interface ideas using HTML and CSS (avoid any serious JavaScript since you will be using React for that)

**Remember: there must be no Citi branding whatsoever**

You could invent some web document ideas, e.g.
* Create layout spaces where content will go, without filling in any details
* Consider user interaction, navigation, any content to show/hide, asynchronous content etc.
* Consider how and when your back end data will be accessed, and how you might show it to the user
* Also consider how data changes wil be implemented in the front end (CRUD) 
* Use your web document ideas to consider the user experience, especially user stories
