### Controlled Form Fields
Create a new React component called CountryForm.jsx

Render input fields for
- countryName (this is the full name, such as 'India')
- countryCode (this is the international code, e.g 'IND')
- countryCurrency (this will be the standard currency for this country, e.g. 'INR')
Also provide a button
Control these fields so that when the user changes them, a stateful model (or models) gets updated
When the user selects the button, add the new country to an array
Show the array nicely in the document
